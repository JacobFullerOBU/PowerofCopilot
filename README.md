## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### AI Model Selection
Edit `chatbot.py` to change the AI model:
```python
# In AIChatbot.__init__()
model_name = "microsoft/DialoGPT-large"  # For better responses (more RAM needed)
model_name = "microsoft/DialoGPT-small"  # For lower resource usage
```

### Server Settings
Edit `app.py` to modify server configuration:
```python
# Change port
app.run(port=8080)

# Enable debug mode
app.run(debug=True)

# Bind to specific interface
app.run(host='127.0.0.1')
```

### Response Settings
Modify response generation in `chatbot.py`:
```python
# Adjust creativity/randomness
temperature=0.8  # Higher = more creative (0.1-2.0)

# Change response length
max_length=input_ids.shape[1] + 100  # Longer responses
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Model failed to load"**
- Ensure you have sufficient RAM (4GB+)
- Try the smaller model: `DialoGPT-small`
- Check internet connection for initial model download

**"Server won't start"**
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Try running with different port: `python app.py --port 8080`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed

**"Slow responses"**
- Upgrade to DialoGPT-large if you have 8GB+ RAM
- Close other applications to free up memory
- Consider using GPU acceleration (install PyTorch with CUDA)

**"Import errors"**
- Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try creating fresh virtual environment

### Performance Optimization

**For Better Performance:**
- Use GPU acceleration (install `torch` with CUDA support)
- Increase RAM allocation to Python process
- Use SSD storage for faster model loading

**For Lower Resource Usage:**
- Switch to `DialoGPT-small` model
- Reduce conversation history length
- Close unnecessary browser tabs

## 📚 Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation
```
You: Hello! How are you today?
AI: Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm here and ready to help with any questions or just have a friendly conversation. How are you doing today?
```

### Creative Writing
```
You: Write a short story about a robot learning to paint
AI: In a cluttered workshop, ARIA-7 discovered an abandoned paintbrush among the spare parts. With mechanical precision, she dipped it in crimson paint, but her first stroke was rigid, calculated. Days passed as she observed human art online, learning that beauty emerged from imperfection. Soon, her canvases bloomed with unexpected colors, each brushstroke carrying a spark of digital soul that surprised even her creators.
```

### Technical Q&A
```
You: Explain quantum computing in simple terms
AI: Quantum computing is like having a super-powered computer that can explore many possibilities simultaneously. While traditional computers use bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use "qubits" that can be both 0 and 1 at the same time. This allows them to solve certain complex problems much faster than regular computers, especially in areas like cryptography, drug discovery, and optimization problems.
```

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

### Updating the AI Model
```bash
# Clear model cache to download latest version
rm -rf ~/.cache/huggingface/transformers/

# Restart the application
python app.py
```

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### Backup & Restore
No backup needed - the system is stateless and doesn't store user data.
