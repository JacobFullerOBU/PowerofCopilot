### Technical Notes

**About "Total Time Listened":**
The Spotify Web API doesn't provide exact listening time data. Instead, this tool uses Spotify's "top tracks" and "top artists" endpoints with the `long_term` time range, which analyzes several years of your listening history and ranks items based on Spotify's popularity algorithm that considers your personal listening patterns.

**Time Ranges:**
- `long_term`: Several years of data (default)
- `medium_term`: Approximately last 6 months
- `short_term`: Approximately last 4 weeks

### Dependencies

- `spotipy`: Official Spotify Web API wrapper for Python
- `python-dotenv`: Environment variable management

### Security

- Your Spotify credentials are stored locally in `.env` (not committed to git)
- OAuth 2.0 authentication ensures secure API access
- No personal data is stored or transmitted outside of Spotify's official API

### Troubleshooting

**"Credentials not found" error:**
- Ensure your `.env` file exists and contains valid Spotify API credentials
- Check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct

**Authentication issues:**
- Verify your Redirect URI in both `.env` and your Spotify app settings
- Make sure `http://localhost:8080` is exactly as configured in your Spotify app

**No data returned:**
- New Spotify accounts may have limited listening history
- Try changing the time range in the code from `long_term` to `medium_term` or `short_term`
